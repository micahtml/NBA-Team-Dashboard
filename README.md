# Los Angeles Lakers Performance Dashboard

The Los Angeles Lakers Performance Dashboard is a data visualization tool built using Power BI. It provides an overview of the Los Angeles Lakers team performance, including game results, player statistics, and other important metrics.

## How it Works

The dashboard retrieves data from basketball-reference.com, specifically the player statistics for the Los Angeles Lakers team. The data is collected and cleaned using Python and the pandas library, and then exported to an Excel file. Power BI Desktop is used to import the Excel file, create relationships between tables (if applicable), and create visualizations.

## Features

- Overall team performance: Visualizations showing the team's win-loss record, ranking, and performance over time.
- Game results: Tables and charts displaying game results, including opponents, scores, and notable player statistics.
